# Abstract Pixel Art Generator

## Description
------------------------------------------WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY------------------------------------------

Duration: one day

This app was an exploration into randomization and playing around with simple css color blocks. Initially it was going to provide a set output on button click, but the thought of having "moving" art that repeatedly generated itself for a short duration before finalizing itself was intriguing. Select a setting from either column and press the corresponding button to trigger the output.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Node.js

## Usage
- Select an option
- Click the corresponding button
- Enjoy~

## Future Plans
- Allow users to select their own color palette
