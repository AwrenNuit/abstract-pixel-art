## Abstract Pixel Art Generator

## Description
-----------------------------------------------WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY-----------------------------------------------

This app was an exploration into randomization and playing around with simple css color blocks. Initially it was going to provide a set output on button click, but the thought of having "moving" art that repeatedly generated itself for a short duration before finalizing itself was intriguing. Select a setting from either column and press the corresponding button to trigger the output.
